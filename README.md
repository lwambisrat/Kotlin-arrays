# Kotlin Array Operations Example

This Kotlin program demonstrates how to work with arrays, including:

- Creating and printing string and integer arrays
- Accessing and updating elements by index
- Adding elements with `plus()`
- Finding an element's index (case-sensitive)
- Iterating through arrays with loops and `forEach`
- Sorting arrays
- Performing operations on integer arrays (sum, count, average, min, max, size)

This example is useful for learning basic array manipulations and common array functions in Kotlin.
